# GitBook introduction

This is a GitBook frontend for my notes repository.

> I've picked up things here and there over the years. Some things I remember,
> some I forget. Some I write down, some I don't. Some I write down twice
> because I forgot about the first time. I'm becoming frustrated with the
> difficulties involved in retrieving solutions to problems I've solved in the
> past. I'll recognize the need for a specific command or pattern, only to
> scour three sets of notes and whichever one of the repositories I worked in
> the last few weeks for the right section of code to review or copy. I want
> these little post-its of bit sized knowledge to be more easily retrieved.

This web interface is useful for sharing notes with friends and colleagues, but
it is not how I consume note contents. Built into the notes repository is a
command line interface which allows for quick entry and retrieval. Read more
about it on [GitHub][1].
